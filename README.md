# openMicroInverter ![ Fig. 0.](figures/oshw-logo-100-px.png  "oshw logo.")
### An open source hardware platform for experimenting with DC-to-AC conversion, power and energy metering and (possibly) grid tie inverters.

### What is the openMicroInverter?
The *openMicroInverter*, or in short *oμiv*, is an **Arduino-UNO based** DC-to-AC power converter. The *oμiv* platform is meant for doing experiments with power electronics and energy systems. The *oμiv* is intended to work as:

1. DC-to-AC power inverter for off the grid applications,
2. AC power meter and energy metering device,
3. an inverter which phase-locks to the grid,
4. solar-inverter or inverter for energy storage systems and
5. a bi-directional power converter.

Why then using the 8-bit Arduino-UNO? Just because it is fun to squeeze the most out of it:-) Furthermore, this project shows the full capabilities of the [TrueRMS](https://github.com/MartinStokroos/TrueRMS) Arduino library from one of my other repositories. Applications i, ii and iii have been successfully realized so far...

This is work in progress...

### How does it work?
The converter topology of the *oμiv* is a single-phase, single-step, transformer coupled power converter with a full-bridge inverter. This type of converter is not as efficient as the combination of a high frequency switching boost converter with DC-to-AC converter, but the *oμiv* is simple to build and it is relatively safe to operate.

### The Hardware
There are two versions of the hardware. The first design is the development model and second design is the final design of the *oμiv* platform. The development model has been used for the development of the software. Please refer to the schematic diagrams to understand further explanation.

**The openMicroInverter development hardware**
A rapid prototype of the inverter was realized for doing software development. The schematic of the development model is named *openMicroInverter_dev.pdf*.
A somewhat older H-bridge driver, the HIP4082, is used for the design. The HIP4082 is a medium voltage, medium frequency full-bridge driver, distributed nowadays by *Renesas*. The driver has a build in turn-on delay to create dead time required for switching between the top and the bottom FET's. With this feature it is possible to drive the chip directly from the PWM generators of the ATmega328P (which are less sophisticated than the timers of STM32 controllers...).

To be continued...

**The openMicroInverter hardware**
The *oμiv* is designed as a single PCB module and is build with low-cost components.
 
This is work is under development...

**Software timing scheme**
The standard Arduino library functions like *analogRead, analogWrite* and *digitalWrite* are very time consuming and can not be used with the *oμiv*. The software requirements are:

* The PWM frequency to steer the H-bridge must be chosen as high as possible.
* The ADC sampling frequency must be a multiple of 50Hz for stable RMS readings.
* If possible, the ADC should be synchronized to the timer used for the PWM generation to force the sampling to happen inbetween the switching transients.
* The PWM duty-cycle is limited by the hardware and can only be used up to about 90%. This is because of the charge pumps from the hi-side FET drivers of the HIP-4082 full-bridge driver. The dynamic range for control is limited in particular when using a 8-bit timer.
* TIM0 should not be used to keep the Arduino time and delay functions working. The Arduino time functions can still be used in the program main loop.

Different schemes are are now being investigated to fit it all inside the Arduino and are::

Scheme | Description | Remarks
------ | ----------- | -------
*scheme-1* | TIM1 generates a PWM-frequency of 16MHz/512/4 = 7812.5Hz (128μs). The 50Hz reference waveform is generated by the DDS algorithm inside the TIM1 ISR. Each TIM1 interrupt the PWM is updated. The ADC-start is triggered by TIM1 and stays synced with TIM1. Six ADC-channels are time-multiplexed. A complete sequence of six channels takes 768us. The closesed whole number of samples that does fit in a 20ms mains cycle is 26.041. This causes a small ripple in the RMS readings. | With scheme, 1 the remaining available processing time in the TIM1 ISR is not enough for implementing power measurements.
*scheme-2* | TIM1 generates a PWM-frequency of 16MHz/(2*1333) = 6000Hz (166.67us). The TIM1 ISR function is empty and only needed to trigger the ADC. All DSP work is done inside the ADC ISR. The 50Hz reference waveform is generated by a DDS algorithm. Each ADC interrupt the PWM is updated and a single analog to digital conversion is processed. Six ADC-channels are time multiplexed. A complete sequence of six channels takes 1ms. Exactly 20 samples do fit in one mains cycle of 20ms. | So far the best scheme. Switching frequency is rather low and the duty-cycle ranges from about 12% to 88%. This is a little too limited and more than needed to keep the HIP-4082 hi-side chargepumps running...
*scheme-3* | TIM1 running at 6kHz triggers the ADC. The PWM is generated with timer2 at the highest possible frequency. The PWM is not synchronized with the sampling proces and the wave amplitude resolution is only 8-bits. | To be confirmed...
*scheme-4* | ADC is free running and the PWM is generated by TIM1 or TIM2 for respectively 10- or 8-bit amplitude resolution in the output wave. The ADC frequency can not be a multiple of 50Hz and a ripple occurs in the RMS readings. | Scheme 4 doesn´t work. There is too much jitter in the sampling frequency when the ADC is in free running mode to be useful.

**Clocking scheme**

The implementation for the clocking scheme 2 as selected, is shown in the following figure:

![ouiv clocking scheme](figures/clocking_scheme_2.png  "ouiv clocking scheme")

In this scheme, the zero crossing detector is no longer needed. The phase is detected by using quadrature sampling of the input signal and a CORDIC function for calculating the phase angle relative to the ADC sampling clock. The phase of the grid voltage is measured and the phase of the DDS reference wave (option A) or the measured inverter output voltage (option B). 
Switch position A is used with example sketch *Inverter2.ino* and switch position B is used with example sketch *Inverter3.ino*. Amplitude control is not implemented yet.

**H-bridge switching mode**

* unipolar switching
* bi-polar switching
* hybrid switching

**The *PowerSys* Library**

Refer to the readme file of the [PowerSys](/libraries/PowerSys/README.md) Library.

**Current Software Status**

1. Now the inverter synchronizes to the grid, but can not operate grid connected since there is no currrent control yet (I was tested only in a very controlled experimental setting).
2. Hybride switching is not working correctly.
3. The plan is to increase the effective duty-cycle range in hybrid-mode by using the AHI and BHI control signals to the HIP-4082.

### Example Sketches
*ZeroCrossingDetector* - This example demonstrates Zero Crossing Detection (ZCD) with the analog comparator of the ATMEGA328. The comparator interrupts on output toggle. The sign of the sine wave is determined from the ADC input. The output of the ZCD only toggles from high to low when the sign of the AC input is positive and vice verse.

**Inverter1.ino -**
Sketch to evaluate the different ways of gating the H-bridge to generate a sine wave output. This sketch works on the *openMicroInverter_dev* hardware. The inverter works in voltage-mode without output voltage control (open loop). The timing is according scheme 1, which gives stable readings of the measurements but the switching frequency is on the low side and the duty-cycle range is limited between 12% and 88%. unipolar switching runs the most smoothly.
#
**Inverter2.ino -**
This sketch synchronizes the internal reference generator to the grid voltage. The DDS (inverter) output wave phase offset can be controlled with a potmeter connected with input A5 (see schematic  *openMicroInverter_dev.pdf* for how to connect the potmeter)
The plot below shows the grid phase and the inverter phase (arbitrary units) when locked. In the locked state the Arduino LED will turn on.
If both lines run perfectly horizontal then the ADC sampling frequency is an exact multiple of 120 times the grid frequency. The grid frequency normally drifts around 50Hz and the *Arduino* crystal oscillator frequency drifts because of temperature effects and aging. The lines are usually not running horizontal.

![Phase comparison](figures/Screenshot_2020-10-30_15-05-11.png  "Phase comparison")

**Inverter3.ino -**
This sketch synchronizes the measured inverter output voltage to the grid voltage. The plot below shows the phase locking when the grid connection is turned on around time stamp 1140.

#
**Metering.ino -**
This sketch is a power meter and energy metering example that works for the *openMicroInverter_dev* hardware.
This sketch uses a time base on interrupt basis and uses an ADC multiplexer running at 6kHz (120*50Hz). Each ADC-channel samples at 1kHz. This example is without inverter drive (H-bridge + transformer and output filter). Re-wire the circuit such that A0 and A2 measure the AC-voltage and A1 the load current. The power is calculated from inputs A1 and A2.

### Acknowledgements
A lot of time was saved in development time by using the alternative Arduino-IDE *Sloeber*. Sloeber is a wonderful Arduino plugin for Eclipse (but the installation of 4.3.3 failed...)
